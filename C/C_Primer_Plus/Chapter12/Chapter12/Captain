O Captain! My Captain!
by Walt Whitman
O Captain! my Captain! our fearful trip is done,
The ship has weathered every rack, the prize we sought is won,
The port is near, the bells I hear, the people all exulting,
While follow eyes the steady keel, the vessel grim and daring;
明明But O heart! heart! heart!
明明明明O the bleeding drops of red,
明明明明明明Where on the deck my Captain lies,
明明明明明明明明Fallen cold and dead.
O Captain! my Captain! rise up and hear the bells;
Rise up--for you the flag is flung--for you the bugle trills,
For you bouquets and ribboned wreaths--for you the shores accrowding,
For you they call, the swaying mass, their eager faces turning;
明明Here Captain! dear father!
明明明明This arm beneath your head!
明明明明明明It is some dream that on the deck
明明明明明明明明You've fallen cold and dead.
My Captain does not answer, his lips are pale and still,
My father does not feel my arm, he has no pulse nor will,
The ship is anchored safe and sound, its voyage closed and done,
From fearful trip the victor ship comes in with object won;
明明Exult O shores, and ring O bells!
明明明明But I, with mournful tread,
明明明明明明Walk the deck my Captain lies,
明明明明明明明明Fallen cold and dead
